Subchapter B General Provisions Relating to Practice and Procedure
§533.2 Purpose and Scope

    This subchapter provides for an efficient and uniform system of practice and procedure before the Commission. This subchapter governs the institution, conduct, and determination of adjudicative proceedings required or permitted by law, whether instituted by the Commission or by the filing of an application, claim, complaint, or any other pleading. This subchapter does not enlarge, diminish, modify, or otherwise alter the jurisdiction, powers, or authority of the Commission, the Executive Director, or the substantive rights of any person or agency.

§533.3 Filing and Notice

    If the Commission denies an application for a license, the Commission shall send the applicant written notice of the denial. An applicant may accept the denial or make a written request for a hearing on that denial. If an applicant fails to request a hearing in writing not later than the 30th day after the date the notice denying an application is sent, the Commission's denial is final.
    When an application is denied by the Commission, no subsequent application will be accepted from the applicant until two years after the date of the Commission's written notice of denial under subsection (a) of this section.
    If after investigation of a possible violation and the facts surrounding that possible violation the Commission determines that a violation has occurred, the Commission may issue a written Notice of Alleged Violation to the respondent. The Commission shall provide notice in accordance with the APA.
    Not later than the 30th day after the date on which the Notice of Alleged Violation is sent, the respondent may:
        accept the determination of the Commission, including sanctions recommended by the Commission; or
        make a written request for a hearing on that determination.
    Upon receipt of a written request for hearing, the Commission shall submit a request to docket case to SOAH accompanied by copies of relevant documents giving rise to a contested case.
    When the Commission submits a request to docket case with SOAH, SOAH acquires jurisdiction over a contested case until SOAH issues final amendments or corrections to the Proposal for Decision. In case of a conflict with the Commission's rules, SOAH's rules control while SOAH has jurisdiction.
    Pleadings, other documents, and service to SOAH shall be filed in accordance with SOAH's rules.
    If a sales agent is a respondent, the Commission will notify the sales agent's sponsoring broker of the hearing. If an apprentice inspector or real estate inspector is a respondent, the Commission will notify the sponsoring professional inspector of the hearing. Notice under this subsection need not be provided by certified or registered mail.
    Any document served upon a party is prima facie evidence of receipt, if it is directed to the party's mailing address or email address. This presumption is rebuttable. Failure to claim properly addressed certified or registered mail will not support a finding of nondelivery.

§533.4 Failure to Answer, Failure to Attend Hearing and Default

    If, not later than the 30th day after the date a Notice of Alleged Violation is sent, the respondent fails to accept the Commission's determination and recommended sanctions, or fails to make a written request for a hearing on the determination, the Commission shall enter a default order against the respondent, incorporating the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the Notice of Alleged Violation, which shall be deemed admitted.
    The Commission may delegate to the Executive Director the Commission's authority to act under Texas Occupations Code, §1101.704(b) and subsection (a) of this section.
    SOAH rules relating to Default Proceedings and Dismissal Proceedings apply when a respondent or applicant fails to appear on the day and time set for administrative hearing. In that case, the Commission's staff may move either for dismissal of the case from SOAH's docket or for the issuance of a default Proposal for Decision by the administrative law judge. If the administrative law judge issues an order dismissing the case from the SOAH docket or issues a default Proposal for Decision, the factual allegations against the respondent or applicant filed at SOAH are admitted and the Commission shall enter a default order against the respondent or applicant as set out in the Notice of Hearing sent to the respondent or applicant.

§533.7 Final Decisions and Orders

    After a Proposal for Decision has been issued by an administrative law judge, the Commission will render the final decision in a contested case or remand the proceeding for further consideration by the administrative law judge. The Commission is responsible for imposing disciplinary action and/or assessing administrative penalties against respondents who are found to have violated any of the Commission's statutes or rules. The Commission welcomes recommendations of administrative law judges as to the sanctions to be imposed, but the Commission is not required to give presumptively binding effect to the administrative law judges' recommendations and is not bound by such recommendations.
    If the Commission remands the case to the administrative law judge, the Commission may direct that further consideration be accomplished with or without reopening the hearing and may limit the issues to be considered. If, on remand, additional evidence is admitted that results in a substantial revision of the Proposal for Decision, or the underlying facts, the administrative law judge shall prepare an amended or supplemental Proposal for Decision and this subchapter applies. Exceptions and replies are limited to items contained in the supplemental Proposal for Decision.
    The Proposal for Decision may be acted on by the Commission after the administrative law judge has ruled on any exceptions or replies to exceptions or on the day following the day exceptions or replies to exceptions were due if no such exceptions or replies were filed.
    Any party may request oral argument before the Commission before the final disposition of the contested case. An oral argument is conducted in accordance with paragraphs (1) - (5) of this subsection.
        The chairperson or the Commission member designated by the chairperson to preside (the presiding member) shall announce the case. Upon the request of any party, the presiding member may conduct a prehearing conference with the parties and their attorneys of record. The presiding member may announce reasonable time limits for any oral arguments presented by the parties.
        The hearing on the Proposal for Decision is limited to the record. New evidence may not be presented on the substance of the case unless the party submitting the evidence establishes that the new evidence was not reasonably available at the time of the original hearing or the party offering the evidence was misled by a party regarding the necessity for offering the evidence at the original hearing.
        In presenting an oral argument, the party bearing the burden of proof opens and closes. The party responding may offer a rebuttal argument. A party may request an opportunity for additional rebuttal subject to the discretion of the presiding member.
        After being recognized by the presiding member, the members of the Commission may ask questions of the parties. If a party is represented by counsel, the Commission must direct the questions to the party's attorney. Questions must be limited to the record and to the arguments made by the parties.
        Upon the conclusion of oral arguments, questions by the members of the Commission, and any discussion by the members of the Commission, the presiding member shall call for a motion regarding disposition of the contested case. The presiding member may vote on the motion. A motion is granted only if a majority of the members present and voting vote in favor of the motion. In the event of a tie vote, the presiding member shall announce that the motion is overruled.
    It is the policy of the Commission to change a finding of fact or conclusion of law in a Proposal for Decision of an administrative law judge when the Commission determines:
        that the administrative law judge did not properly apply or interpret applicable law, agency rules, written policies provided by staff, or prior administrative decisions;
        that a prior administrative decision on which the administrative law judge relied is incorrect or should be changed; or
        that a technical error in a finding of fact should be changed.
    If the Commission modifies, amends, or changes a finding of fact or conclusion of law in a Proposal for Decision, the order shall reflect the Commission's changes and state the specific reason and legal basis for the changes. If the Commission does not follow the recommended sanctions in a Proposal for Decision, the order shall explain why the Commission chose not to follow the recommendation.
    Final orders on contested cases shall be in writing and signed by the presiding officer of the Commission. Final orders shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law separately stated from disciplinary actions imposed and administrative penalties assessed. Parties will be notified and given a copy of the decision as provided by the APA. A decision is final as provided by the APA.
    If the Commission or the Executive Director finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare requires immediate effect of a final decision or order, that finding shall be recited in the decision or order as well as the fact that the decision or order is final and effective on the date signed. The decision or order is then final and appealable on the date signed and a motion for rehearing is not required as a prerequisite for appeal.
    Conflict of Interest. A Commission member shall recuse themselves from all deliberations and votes regarding any matter:
        the member reviewed during an informal proceeding pursuant to §533.25 of this chapter;
        involving persons or transactions about which the member has a conflict of interest; or
        involving persons or transactions related to the member such that it creates the appearance of a conflict of interest.

In the absence of specific grounds in the motion, the Commission will take no action and the motion will be overruled by operation of law.
    The Commission delegates authority to hear and rule on motions for rehearing to the Commission's Enforcement Committee, consisting of three Commission members appointed by the Commission chair. A motion for rehearing may be ruled upon pursuant to §2001.146(d), Texas Government Code.
    Any party may request oral arguments before the Enforcement Committee prior to the final disposition of the motion for rehearing. If the Enforcement Committee grants a request for oral argument, oral arguments will be conducted in accordance with paragraphs (1) - (5) of this subsection.
        The chair of the Enforcement Committee or the member designated by the chair to preside (the presiding member) shall announce the case.

The presiding member may announce reasonable time limits for any oral arguments to be presented by the parties.
        The hearing on the motion shall be limited to a consideration of the grounds set forth in the motion. Testimony by affidavit or documentary evidence, such as excerpts of the record before the presiding officer, may be offered in support of, or in opposition to, the motion; provided, however, a party offering affidavit testimony or documentary evidence must provide the other party with copies of the affidavits or documents at the time the motion is filed.

        Upon the conclusion of oral arguments, questions by the members of the Enforcement Committee, and any discussion by the members of the Enforcement Committee, the presiding member shall call for a vote on the motion. A member of the Enforcement Committee need not make a separate motion or second a motion filed by a party. The presiding member may vote on the motion.

In the event of a tie vote, the presiding member shall announce that the motion is overruled.
    A petition for judicial review must be filed in a District Court of Travis County Texas as provided by the APA. A party filing a petition for judicial review must also comply with the requirements of Texas Occupations Code, §1101.707.

The respondent shall execute the proposed agreed order and return the executed order to the Commission not later than the 10th day after their receipt of the proposed agreed order.
